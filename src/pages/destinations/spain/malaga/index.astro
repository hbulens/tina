            Málaga, nestled along Spain’s famous Costa del Sol, is an
            increasingly popular cycling destination that offers something for
            everyone—from seasoned riders to beginners looking to explore the
            region’s diverse terrain. While the city is best known for its
            challenging mountain routes that attract experienced cyclists, it
            also offers a variety of gentler paths that cater to different skill
            levels.
          </p>

          <p class="mb-4">
            The area boasts a variety of climbs that cater to different
            preferences and skill levels. From short, steep ascents to long,
            steady climbs, Málaga has it all. Natural parks like the Montes de
            Málaga and the nearby Sierras de Tejeda in Axarquia are home to
            routes that challenge even the fittest cyclists, with tough
            gradients and technical descents. Climbs like the Puerto del León,
            El Torcal and Puerto del Sol offer a mix of difficulty and stunning
            views, attracting those looking for serious training or adventure.
          </p>

          <p class="mb-4">
            Yet Málaga isn’t just for the seasoned cyclist. The city’s flat,
            coastal promenade offers more relaxed routes perfect for beginners
            or leisure cyclists wanting to enjoy seaside views. Further inland,
            rolling hills, olive groves, and quiet country roads offer
            intermediate riders scenic routes with varying difficulty levels.
          </p>
          <p>
            The infrastructure supports all types of cyclists with good roads,
            lots of cafes, rental shops and guided tours available throughout
            the region. Málaga’s climate is ideal for cycling most of the year,
            although summers can be hot, making the spring and autumn months
            especially popular, and even the winter months are doable. With its
            combination of challenging climbs, scenic rides, and rich cultural
            experiences, Málaga truly offers something for every type of
            cyclist.
